# Efficient TAS

This is an anonymous repository for paper titled "Efficient Time Sampling Strategy for Transient Absorption Spectroscopy" submitted to ICCP 2024 (submission ID 38)


## Run simulation
To run simulation, please go to `src` folder and run following code.
```
python main_simulation.py expnumber
```

Expnumber could be one of the followings.

- 3 (or fig3) : Generate plots for figure 3. (comprehensive comparison) 
- 4 (or fig4) : Generate plots for figure 4. (using different initial taus)
- 5 (or fig5) : Generate plots for figure 5. (using heteroscedastic noise)
- 6 (or fig6) : Generate plots for figure 6. (using linear curve fitting)
 

You can find output in `result` folder.
We already included the plots, so please check them.

 ## Real-data
 We will release real-data after the acceptance.
